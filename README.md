# cronet-binaries ![build workflow](https://github.com/sleeyax/cronet-binaries/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)
Pre-built, cross-platform binaries for [cronet](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/cronet/README.md) (Chromium's networking stack). New cronet binaries will be published to [releases](https://github.com/sleeyax/cronet-binaries/releases) as soon as new versions of Chromium are released.

This repository is based on [NaiveProxy](https://github.com/klzgrad/naiveproxy)'s excellent build system, but doesn't include any naive proxy binaries, tests or go files. The last release of Naive that came with standalone cronet binaries was [v106.0.5249.91-3](https://github.com/klzgrad/naiveproxy/releases/tag/v106.0.5249.91-3) (Nov 2, 2022).
